  |   Will you play as the noble and experienced adventurer Alexandra of    |
  |   Blacksand? Or perhaps take the pious and righteous path of            |
  |   battle-priest Landov Lowan? Forego the risks of combat with evasive   |
  |   sleep-bomb manouveurs as Krea Datura! Or get straight to the punch    |
